# Updated readme file for my bank modelling.

# Skye Bank modelling via POJO and JavaBeans

* User Full Name variable was created
* Account.java class was created
* Card.java class was created
* Constant *enum* files for Account.java and Card.java was created
 
 
 * Note Some errors with my Card.java and CrdType.java class. The error is in using the enum dataType to call cardType
 
 Somewhere here:
```  //settersAndGetters for cardType
		public void setCardType (crdType cType){
			this.cardType = cType;
		}
		public crdType getCardType (){
			return this.cardType;
		}
```
and here:
``` 
  public enum crdType {
		MASTERCARD,
		VISACARD,
		VERVECARD;
		
	}
```	

# Edit: 
Errors have been corrected.
